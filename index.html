      <p>
        This page serves as a hub and overview for each of the projects that I am or have been working on that I wish 
        to be publicly available or hosted.
      </p>
      <p>
        Projects will be predominantly developed in JavaScript or TypeScript. JS because that is what I use at work, though 
        I do come from the more type-strict background of C# and Java so TS has been more appealing of late.

      <h1>Night Wave Tower Defence</h1>

      <p class="status complete">Status: Complete</p>

      <p>
        A game that Imade in the Godot engine.<br/>
        Nightwave is a tower defence game inspired by the Kingdom Rush games, sans the heroes.<br/>
        The twist with this variation is that monsters are obscured by darkness and so the player must first build towers that illuminate
        the path so that other towers may shoot at them.

      <p>
        A game that I am making in the Godot engine.<br/>
        This is a 2D, souls-like, metroidvania, single player game set in a dark fantasy world.<br/>
        Inspired by the likes of Hollow Knight and Salt & Sanctuary.

      <h1>Warhammer 40K 8th Edition List Builder</h1>

      <p class="status hold">Status: On Hold - Progresses only in occassional, short, and rapid bursts of motivation</p>

      <p class="hold">
        Currently this project is not getting any love as I haven't been playing 40K. Instead I've been trying
        out the new Kill Teams which is rather enjoyable. And in this case the BattleScribe app does quite a nice job of
        creating lists, so I have not felt the need to create my own.
      </p>

      <p>
        I started this project for two reasons:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Paging back and forth through multiple rule books composing your army and hoping that you got all of the
            costs and special rules/dependencies correct is a real pain.
          </li>
          <li>
            The list building applications that already exist are unstaisfactory (to me at least). The official app -
            Command Roster -
            is disgustingly under-featured and the best free contender - BattleScribe - is not the easiest/nicest to
            use.
          </li>
        </ul>
        So I decided to make my own web-based list builder. Originally this was planned to cater for all armies, however
        once I got round to translating the rules for the factions I play (Craftworlds, Harlequins, and Ynnari) I realised just
        how big of a task that would be. So, for now at least, this project will only support my factions, but should be able to support the
        others if I ever get around to adding their data.

      <p>
        I started using CodePen at one point to play around with some of the simpler physics challenges and 2d game mechanics.
        For example the below code pen is a work-in-progress attempt at detecting and resolving collisions between different shapes:

    <!-- discarded projects -->
    <div class="anchor" id="discarded"></div>
    <h1>Discarded Projects</h1>

    <p>
      Every developer is going to have tons of discarded projects. I am no different. Some noteworthy examples in my case are:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>2D game engine</b> - I attempted this a few times, first in JavaScript (what I use at work) and then again in TypeScript. 
        I got quite far, developing from scratch a complete ECS architecture, asset management, audio manager, scene manager, etc. What 
        I did not complete was the renderer or physics. At first I used the built in canvas renderer, but that is nowhere near good enough 
        for games, so I started working on a custom WebGL2 renderer. I enjoyed myself so much that I decided to write a proepr 3D renderer 
        instead. Which is where this project lost steam.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>3D game engine</b> - Once I learned how to use OpenGL I started working on a 3D game engine. This was done while following along 
        with an excellent YouTube series by The Cherno that was teaching how to make a 2D game engine using C++ and OpenGL. I was planning to 
        use that as a base and extend it to 3D. It ended up taking too long and the scope of what I was wanting to do made me decide it would 
        be more worthwhile to use an existing engine if I actually wanted to create games before I retired.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>3D arena shooter</b> - Had an idea of a simple, parkour-based, multi-player shooter. Started development on that in Godot, but 
        other projects became a priority and so I dropped it.
      </li>
    </ul>
