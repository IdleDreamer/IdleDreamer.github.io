      <h1>About</h1>

      <p>
        This page serves as a hub and overview for each of the projects that I am or have been working on that I wish 
        to be publicly available or hosted.
      </p>
      <p>
        Projects will be predominantly developed in JavaScript or TypeScript. JS because that is what I use at work, though 
        I do come from the more type-strict background of C# and Java so TS has been more appealing of late.

      <h1>Warhammer 40K 8th Edition List Builder</h1>

      <p class="status hold">Status: On Hold - Progresses only in occassional, short, and rapid bursts of motivation</p>

      <p class="hold">
        Currently this project is not getting any love as I haven't been playing 40K recently. Instead I've been trying
        out the new Kill Teams which is rather enjoyable. And in this case the BattleScribe app does quite a nice job of
        creating lists, so I have not felt the need to create my own.
      </p>

      <p>
        I started this project for two reasons:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Paging back and forth through multiple rule books composing your army and hoping that you got all of the
            costs and special rules/dependencies correct is a real pain.
          </li>
          <li>
            The list building applications that already exist are unstaisfactory (to me at least). The official app -
            Command Roster -
            is disgustingly under-featured and the best free contender - BattleScribe - is not the easiest/nicest to
            use.
          </li>
        </ul>
        So I decided to make my own web-based list builder. Originally this was planned to cater for all armies, however
        once I got round to translating the rules for the factions I play (Craftworlds, Harlequins, and Ynnari) I realised just
        how big of a task that would be. So, for now at least, this project will only support my factions, but should be able to support the
        others if I ever get around to adding their data.

      <h1>2D Game Engine</h1>

      <p class="status inprogress">Status: Started - Progressing Slowly</p>

      <p>
        This project is (as the title suggests) a 2D game engine. This seems to be a popular choice of project for
        small teams and startups these days. This particular engine is intended to be used to create web-based games
        and is being developed in TypeScript.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Why would someone want a web-based game engine knowing the restrictions of the platform?</i><br/>
        Honestly I've debated this with myself numerous times, however I keep settling back on web-based due to the appeal 
        of accessibility and, to some degree, the challenge of seeing if I can make it work.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>If you just want to make games then why not just use one of the existing engines?</i><br/>
        I am rather biased against using libraries and engines. Mostly because of the excess code that comes them that you 
        never use, the extra processing that you might not be making use of but runs anyway. But also because I like to 
        understand the code I'm using, so unless the code-base is small enough for me to read through and understand then I 
        prefer to write it myself. That way I learn more as well.

      <h1>CodePen Account</h1>

      <p>
        I started using CodePen at one point to play around with some of the simpler physics challenges and 2d game mechanics.
        For example the below code pen is a work-in-progress attempt at detecting and resolving collisions between different shapes:
